## NetworkTools

A multi-threaded powershell webserver for file and REST requests. This is just a proof of concept as a web front end that runs powershell commands and returns the results to the browser. Shouldn't need admin permissions as its running on localhost and it attempts to open the browser when it starts up (Tested on Win10).
